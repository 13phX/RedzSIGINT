# RedzSIGINT
Software framework for your own SIGINT platform 

Hey all. So I have been stacked with work and other commitments since DerbyCon. Unfortunately I am going to be even more stacked till some time in 2016 but have started to upload some files. I wanted to upload them all at the same time but that is not going to happen. I do plan on spending an hour a week working on this, so the updates will come, they will just be slow. 

Just because I am super busy, does not mean I canâ€™t answer questions, if you have any, just let me know. 

If you helped me with this project in some way and I have not given you a shout out, please let me know. I will make sure to put your name in the docs.
